## How does cmod3 work?

cmod3 is entirely written in **Javascript**, works on node-webkit (nwjs) and uses libopenmpt compiled with emscripten plus closure-compiler. The user interface is based on bootstrap and angular is the framework of choice. Despite all that, and after some hard work, it performs really well.

## Things yet to do

* Can you draw? An app icon is needed.
* Audio is being decoded on the main thread, which is not ideal, it should be done on a background worker/thread and see if it performs better.
* Settings are not being saved yet.
* Keyboard shortcuts.
* Play/Stop could be the same button.
* Adding an AnalyserNode could enable fft visualization.
* Volume control using a GainNode.
* Choose a Nectarine stream among a list of streams.
